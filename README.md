# TicTacToe
This is a simple, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to compete against each other or a single player to compete against the computer. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, with each player taking turns to place their mark (either "X" or "O") in an empty cell. The first player to align three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
